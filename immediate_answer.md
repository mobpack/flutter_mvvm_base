# Storage Service Analysis & Provider-based Interface Approach

## 1. Analysis of Current Storage Service
- **File**: `storage_service.dart`
- **Responsibilities**: Handles both regular storage (via `SharedPreferences`) and secure storage (via `FlutterSecureStorage`).
- **Methods**: Provides `setString`, `getString`, `setBool`, `getBool`, `remove` for regular storage; and `setSecureString`, `getSecureString`, `removeSecure`, `clearSecureStorage` for secure storage.
- **Usage**: Currently implemented as a concrete class, likely injected via GetIt or similar DI.

## 2. Plan: Introduce Interface, Implementation, and Provider
- **Step 1**: Define an abstract interface, e.g., `IStorageService`, with all public methods.
- **Step 2**: Refactor `StorageService` to implement `IStorageService`.
- **Step 3**: Create a Riverpod provider for `IStorageService` (using the concrete implementation).
- **Step 4**: Update usage throughout the codebase to depend on `IStorageService` via the provider, not the concrete class.

## 3. Pros & Cons Table: Interface + Provider Approach

| Aspect           | Pros                                                                 | Cons                                             |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Testability**  | Easy to mock/override in tests via provider overrides                | Slightly more boilerplate                        |
| **Flexibility**  | Swap implementations (e.g., for web, mobile, or mocks) easily        | Interface maintenance required                   |
| **Abstraction**  | Decouples app logic from storage details                             | Risk of over-abstraction for simple use cases    |
| **Best Practices**| Aligns with SOLID, MVVM, and Riverpod recommendations               | Must ensure all features are exposed in interface|
| **Scalability**  | Supports future extension (e.g., multi-backend, feature flags)        | Initial refactor effort                          |
| **Consistency**  | Unified access via Riverpod, no direct dependency on implementation  | Requires team discipline to use interface        |

## 4. Recommendation
- **Adopt this approach** for maintainability, testability, and future-proofing.
- Use `Provider<IStorageService>` or `FutureProvider<IStorageService>` for async init.
- Document the interface and provider for clarity.
