# Architectural Issues & Actionable Advice

## 1. Directory Nesting

**Issue:**
The data layer has deep subfolders (`repository/`, `supabase/`, `storage/`), which could make navigation and onboarding harder as the project grows.

**Recommendation:**
- Flatten the `lib/data` directory where possible. Group by domain (`data/auth/`, `data/user/`) rather than technical type if it makes navigation easier.
- Use clear, consistent naming to differentiate implementations (e.g., `auth_repository_impl.dart`, `supabase_data_source.dart`).
- Only keep subfolders where the domain complexity justifies it.

## 2. Provider Placement

**Issue:**
Providers are sometimes colocated with data sources, making them harder to find and maintain at scale.

**Recommendation:**
- Move all providers to a dedicated directory such as `lib/shared/providers/` or `lib/data/providers/`.
- Name providers consistently (e.g., `auth_provider.dart`, `user_provider.dart`).
- Document provider usage and structure in your project guide.

## 3. Feature Modularity

**Issue:**
While features are separated (e.g., `features/auth`, `features/user`), business logic and state management could leak across feature boundaries.

**Recommendation:**
- Ensure each feature module encapsulates its own state, UI, and business logic.
- Avoid importing providers, repositories, or state from one feature into another unless it’s a shared module.
- Use clear boundaries and interfaces for cross-feature communication (e.g., via domain interfaces).

## 4. Duplication Risk

**Issue:**
Similar repository/provider patterns are repeated across features, leading to boilerplate and maintenance overhead.

**Recommendation:**
- Use code generation tools (`freezed`, `riverpod_annotation`, etc.) to reduce repetitive code.
- Abstract common patterns into base classes or mixins where appropriate.
- Regularly review and refactor for DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles.

---

**Summary:**
Flatten your directory structure, centralize and standardize providers, enforce strict feature boundaries, and use code generation or abstraction to reduce duplication. These steps will make your codebase easier to navigate, maintain, and scale as it grows.
