# Core

This directory contains core functionality and utilities used throughout the application.

## Structure

- **constants/**: App-wide constants and configuration values
- **extensions/**: Dart and Flutter extension methods
- **logging/**: Logging functionality and configuration
- **utils/**: Utility functions and helper methods

## Best Practices

1. Keep utility functions pure and stateless when possible
2. Document all public APIs with DartDoc comments
3. Write unit tests for all utility functions
4. Use meaningful naming that clearly indicates the purpose of each utility
5. Follow Dart and Flutter best practices for code style and organization
