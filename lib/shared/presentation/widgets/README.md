# Shared Widgets

Reusable widgets used across multiple features, organized by type:

- **buttons/**: Button components
- **dialogs/**: Dialog components
- **feedback/**: Error and feedback components
- **forms/**: Form components and inputs
  - **dynamic_form/**: Dynamic form generation components
- **layouts/**: Layout components like scaffolds and app shells
- **screens/**: Common screen templates

Follow Flutter MVVM architecture and use stateless widgets unless state is required.
