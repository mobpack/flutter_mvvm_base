# Dependency Injection Analysis: GetIt vs Riverpod

## 1. Project Dependency Overview (`pubspec.yaml`)
- **GetIt**: `get_it: ^8.0.3` is included and actively used for dependency injection.
- **Riverpod**: `flutter_riverpod`, `riverpod_annotation`, and `riverpod_generator` are present, indicating Riverpod is also used for state management and possibly DI in some areas.
- **freezed/freezed_annotation**: Used for data classes and state objects, following best practices.

## 2. Current Dependency Injection Structure

### a. GetIt-based DI (Service Locator)
- **Location**: `/lib/di/service_locator.dart`, `/lib/di/module.dart`, `/lib/di/modules/`
- **Pattern**: Modular registration via `DIModule` subclasses (e.g., `ServiceModule`, `AuthModule`, `UserModule`), all using `getIt`.
- **Services Registered**: Core services (e.g., `StorageService`, `SupabaseService`), repositories, and use cases are registered as singletons or factories.
- **Initialization**: `setupServiceLocator()` initializes all modules and waits for async singletons (e.g., `SupabaseService`).
- **Usage**: Throughout data/repository layers, dependencies are injecvted via `getIt<T>()`.

### b. Riverpod-based Providers
- **Location**: `/lib/features/*/presentation/provider/`, `/lib/features/forms/domain/providers/`
- **Pattern**: Providers (annotated with `@riverpod` or using `Provider`, `StateNotifierProvider`, etc.) wrap view models and state objects.
- **Usage**: In UI and presentation layers, widgets use `ref.watch(...)` or `ref.read(...)` to access providers.
- **Hybrid**: Many Riverpod providers still resolve use cases or repositories from GetIt (e.g., `LoginProvider`, `UsersProvider`, `SettingsViewModel`).

## 3. Comparison Table: GetIt vs Riverpod for Dependency Injection

| Criteria                | GetIt (Service Locator)                               | Riverpod (Provider-based)                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Pattern**             | Service Locator (Imperative)                         | Provider/DI (Declarative, Reactive)              |
| **Registration**        | Manual, modular, central registry                    | Declarative, via providers                       |
| **Access**              | `getIt<T>()` anywhere                               | Scoped via `ref.watch`/`ref.read`                |
| **Testability**         | Good, but requires manual override                   | Excellent, supports overrides/mocking            |
| **Hot Reload**          | Not reactive to changes                              | Fully reactive, supports hot reload              |
| **Lifecycle**           | Manual control (singleton, factory, async)           | Managed by provider scopes                       |
| **IDE Support**         | Less refactoring support, more runtime errors        | Strong type safety, compile-time checks          |
| **Learning Curve**      | Simple API, easy for small/medium projects           | Steeper, but more powerful for complex apps      |
| **Performance**         | Minimal overhead, direct lookup                     | Slightly more overhead, but optimized            |
| **State Management**    | Not included                                         | Built-in, unified with DI                        |
| **Best Use Case**       | Legacy apps, simple DI, non-reactive services        | Modern Flutter, stateful/reactive UIs, testing   |
| **Drawbacks**           | Harder to track dependencies, less reactive, global  | Boilerplate for simple cases, learning curve     |

## 4. Summary & Recommendations
- **Current Approach**: The project uses a hybrid approach: GetIt for core DI and Riverpod for state management and UI logic.
- **Pros**: Leverages strengths of both systems; GetIt is simple for service setup, Riverpod excels at UI and state.
- **Cons**: Some duplication, harder to migrate fully to Riverpod; hybrid approach can increase maintenance complexity.
- **Recommendation**: For new features, prefer Riverpod for both DI and state management (as per best practices and user rules). Gradually migrate service/repository DI to Riverpod providers for improved testability, reactivity, and maintainability.

## 5. Migration Plan: Move to Riverpod-Only Dependency Injection

This plan details how to migrate all dependency injection in `/lib/services`, `/lib/shared/theme`, and `/lib/features` to use only Riverpod, eliminating GetIt. The steps follow Flutter/Riverpod best practices and the MVVM architecture.

### Step 1: Preparation & Audit
- **Inventory** all services, repositories, and use cases currently registered with GetIt in the target directories.
- **List all providers** already using Riverpod (e.g., `@riverpod`, `Provider`, `StateNotifierProvider`).
- **Identify dependencies** in ViewModels and services that are injected via GetIt.

### Step 2: Create Riverpod Providers for All Services
- For each service (e.g., `StorageService`, `SupabaseService`), create a corresponding Riverpod provider in a `providers.dart` file within the relevant module or a central location.
  - Use `Provider` for stateless/singleton-like services.
  - Use `FutureProvider` or `AsyncNotifierProvider` for async initialization (e.g., services needing `await` in constructors).
- Example:
  ```dart
  final storageServiceProvider = Provider<StorageService>((ref) {
    final prefs = ref.watch(sharedPreferencesProvider);
    return StorageService(prefs);
  });
  ```

### Step 3: Refactor Repositories and Use Cases
- Refactor repositories and use cases to receive dependencies via Riverpod providers, not GetIt.
- Create providers for repositories/use cases as needed:
  ```dart
  final userRepositoryProvider = Provider<UserRepository>((ref) {
    final userService = ref.watch(userServiceProvider);
    return UserRepositoryImpl(userService: userService);
  });
  ```

### Step 4: Refactor ViewModels and State Notifiers
- Change all ViewModels/StateNotifiers to receive dependencies via Riverpod providers (`ref.watch(...)`), not GetIt.
- Annotate with `@riverpod` or use `StateNotifierProvider` as appropriate.
- Remove any direct `getIt<T>()` calls.

### Step 5: Refactor UI Layer
- In widgets, replace any `getIt` usage with Riverpod’s `ref.watch` or `ref.read`.
- Ensure all dependencies are accessed via providers.

### Step 6: Remove GetIt
- Once all dependencies are provided via Riverpod, remove all GetIt registration and usage from the codebase, including:
  - `/lib/di/`
  - `setupServiceLocator()`
  - All `getIt.register*` and `getIt<T>()` calls
- Delete the DI modules and service locator files.

### Step 7: Testing & Validation
- Write or update unit, widget, and integration tests to use Riverpod’s override capabilities for mocking dependencies.
- Run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` to ensure correctness.
- Validate hot reload/hot restart works as expected.

### Step 8: Documentation & Best Practices
- Document all new providers with DartDoc.
- Ensure all public APIs and complex logic are documented.
- Prefer `@riverpod` code generation for maintainability.
- Use `ProviderScope` for scoping and overrides in tests.

### Special Considerations
- For async services (e.g., those needing `SharedPreferences.getInstance()`), use `FutureProvider` or `AsyncNotifierProvider`.
- For theme management in `/lib/shared/theme`, use a `StateNotifierProvider` or `NotifierProvider` for theme state and expose it via Riverpod.
- For MVVM, keep ViewModels as StateNotifiers or Notifiers and expose them via Riverpod providers.

### Example: Simple Service Migration
**Before (GetIt):**
```dart
final getIt = GetIt.instance;
getIt.registerSingleton<StorageService>(StorageService(prefs));
...
final storage = getIt<StorageService>();
```
**After (Riverpod):**
```dart
final storageServiceProvider = Provider<StorageService>((ref) {
  final prefs = ref.watch(sharedPreferencesProvider);
  return StorageService(prefs);
});
...
final storage = ref.watch(storageServiceProvider);
```
